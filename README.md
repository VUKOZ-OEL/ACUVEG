# AKUVEG  

## Project goals:  

The aim of the project is to develop a public methodology on the use of vegetation belts for traffic
noise attenuation and an accompanying illustrative database. Further partial research information
obtained will be used for the modifications of the technical regulations. The main idea is to find a suitable spatial and species composition of woody plants, which will be
established specifically to attenuate traffic noise. Measurements will focus on different woody
species composition, spatial structure and density, phenological phase, width and height of belts, etc. Vegetation stands that are expected to be usable in at least 20-30 years will be examined with
respect to climate change. Vegetation can also be assumed to have another significant ecological
and (bio)climatological function.
